Recently, the Vanderbilt University football team came under fire for tweeting a graphic involving the term 'We Don't Need Your Permission'. This discretion comes in the wake of an embarrassing scandal involving now-former football players who were charged with rape. The tweet was removed soon afterwards, but not after some PR moves from the university:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">RT <a href="https://twitter.com/VandyFootball">@vandyfootball</a>: We apologize for today’s tweet. It’s not a comment about sexual assault. Sex without permission is always wrong. (1/2)</p>&mdash; Vanderbilt (@VanderbiltU) <a href="https://twitter.com/VanderbiltU/status/629350942647951360">August 6, 2015</a></blockquote>

Vanderbilt University, a bastion of scholastic excellence, a place that produces some of the brightest doctors, lawyers and leaders in their field, felt the need to let the world know that they, in fact, believe rape is wrong. Truly a bold, progressive stance from one of our nation's thought leaders.

Brands apologizing is one of my favorite new things of the internet age. No longer can a brand hide behind a large building, a team of lawyers, and a pile of cash. If they mess up, they hand off the apology tweet to be sent by some millennial marketing junior with a Social Networking skill on their LinkedIn profile. Here are some of my favorite brand apologizing moments:

# KitchenAid
The makers of your favorite appliances have a few words for Mr. NO-bama:

> "Obamas gma even knew it was going 2 b bad! 'She died 3 days b4 he became president'. #nbcpolitics"

A pointed statement, but I think their social media director misunderstood the company's directive to go after the empty-nester market. Apparently the only thing more expensive than this PR blunder is one of their standing mixers. Now it's time to bask in that sweet apology:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Deepest apologies for an irresponsible tweet that is in no way a representation of the brand&#39;s opinion. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nbcpolitics?src=hash">#nbcpolitics</a></p>&mdash; KitchenAid (@KitchenAidUSA) <a href="https://twitter.com/KitchenAidUSA/status/253673520700198914">October 4, 2012</a></blockquote>

# Bing
Bing, you know, that search engine that you have to google to find, is all about some brand exposure. What's a horrific natural disaster if no one bings about it? Well, Bing tried to up their game with this tweet:

> How you can #SupportJapan – http://binged.it/fEh7iT. For every retweet, @bing will give $1 to Japan quake victims, up to $100K

As you can imagine, this didn't go over very well. Bing did the right thing eventually, and no, I'm not talking about redirecting their domain to google.com:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We apologize the tweet was negatively perceived. Intent was to provide an easy way for people to help Japan. We have donated $100K.</p>&mdash; Bing (@bing) <a href="https://twitter.com/bing/status/46698091604226048">March 12, 2011</a></blockquote>

# Home Depot
Home Depot is the preferred place for men to go to on a Saturday to get away from their kids, and they know their demographic well. Their crack team pushed out a tweet one fine Saturday morning with a picture of 3 men sitting in front of buckets (2 black men and one man in a monkey suit). The tweet contained the caption, "Which drummer is not like the others?". Their company's social media strategy and the general public soon proved that their paint department isn't the only thing that doesn't mix well. This tweet became immediately necessary:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have zero tolerance for anything so stupid and offensive. Deeply sorry. We terminated agency and individual who posted it.</p>&mdash; The Home Depot (@HomeDepot) <a href="https://twitter.com/HomeDepot/status/398591812022976512">November 7, 2013</a></blockquote>

At some point you have to wonder, is twitter for enterprise even worth it? Can you engage customers enough to affect your bottom line, all while factoring in the possibility of a disastrous situation at the click of a button? I believe it is, but you need to have some checks and balances on your team, along with some editorial oversight, to make sure you don't end up in the news. Or your apology better be good.

If you have any favorites, tweet me or comment below, I would love to hear about them.

Thanks for reading!
