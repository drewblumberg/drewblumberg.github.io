'In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.' This is a cute rhyme that we like to teach children. It's succinct, easy to remember, and it's a good start for kids on the traditional path of American history education (God forbid that we make children do any critical thinking, I think memorizing dates is a great form of education). But alas, that is a conversation for another day. Today, we discuss the man behind the saying, one Christopher Columbus.

Today is Columbus Day in the United States, a day that was created so that DMV workers could have an extra day off. A day where we celebrate a man that sailed to current-day America four times. I think by this point, most intelligent people know that Columbus did not discover North America, nor did any Scandinavian fellow. The Western Hemisphere was like that twenty dollar bill that you find in a pair of old jeans. It remained outside your everyday routine, but it has been there for a long time and you are just now realizing it was there.

So why Columbus? What was so special about him? Sure, he was an influential person in one of the greatest empires every known, and probably a pretty charismatic person as well. He was appointed Viceroy and Governor of the Indies after his first voyage to the US, making him the first corrupt Governor of <span class="strikethru">Illinois</span> North America. But Columbus was more than just a Spanish figurehead. He was just awful. I mean, clearly, unequivicoally terrible. If I could create a list of people to avoid holiday designation, Columbus would certainly be on it.

Seriously, America needs to do a better job of picking its heroes. Here's a list of 'improvements' Columbus made to the Americas:
<ul>
  <li>Columbus regularly used torture and mutilation as 'tools' to govern</li>
  <li>To quell rebellions, Columbus ordered many natives to be killed and then paraded their dismembered bodies through the streets in an attempt to discourage further rebellion</li>
  <li>He committed genocide of local populations in 'discovered' portions of Hispaniola</li>
  <li>He pioneered the sex slavery trade in the western hemisphere, selling girls as young as 9</li>
</ul>

There you have it, the rap sheet of a man given a national holiday. Had he existed today, I believe we would have a Joseph Kony-esque manhunt for him. He'd be hiding in a bungalo somewhere wearing a 'Make America Great Again' hat. I sincerely hope that by the time I'm dead, we'll have done away with this holiday and replaced it with a man who truly deserves a holiday. Perhaps somebody like George W. Bush.
